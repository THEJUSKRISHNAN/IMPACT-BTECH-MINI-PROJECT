        IMPACT: Integrated Modeling for Predictive Analysis and Crisis Tracking is a disaster management system designed to predict, monitor,
        and respond to natural disasters, particularly landslides. By integrating machine learning, and AI-driven assistance,
        the system provides early warnings and emergency support to authorities, rescue teams, and individuals. One of its key features is an
        AI-powered chatbot, which offers instant responses to user queries regarding landslide risks, suggests preventive measures based on
        location, and connects users to disaster relief resources. Additionally, the weather forecasting module fetches real-time data such as
        rainfall, humidity, and temperature to alert users about conditions that may trigger landslides or floods, ensuring better preparedness.
        To enhance emergency response, the system includes an Emergency Evacuation and Disaster Relief Camp Finder, which displays nearby
        evacuation centers and safe zones on a map, provides real-time updates on shelter capacity.Another crucial feature is the SMS Alert System, which sends real-time alerts when a landslide risk is detected, notifies emergency
        contacts and authorities, and provides safety instructions for immediate action. This system is an essential tool for disaster management teams, government agencies, and communities
        in landslide-prone areas, helping to minimize casualties and improve crisis response through data-driven decision-making and real-time
        alerts.
